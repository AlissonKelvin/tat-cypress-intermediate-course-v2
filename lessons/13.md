# Shutting down the container

1. In the command line terminal, run the command `docker container ls`, press ENTER and copy the `CONTAINER ID` referring to the image `wlsf82/gitlab-ce`

2. Finally, execute the command `docker container stop [CONTAINER ID copied in the previous step]` and press ENTER.

> **Note:** After turning off the container, if you want to start it again, use the following commands.

```sh
# List all your downloaded containers
docker ps -a

# After that, "grab" the CONTAINER ID of the wlsf82/gitlab-ce image.

# Then, run:
docker container start [CONTAINER ID copied in the previous step]

```
