# Testing the project creation functionality

In this lesson, your challenge is to test the project creation scenario successfully.

## Exercise 1 - Project creation

Create an automated test that exercises project creation functionality via the GUI.

<details><summary>If in doubt, open to see the step-by-step</summary>
</br>

1. Inside the `cypress/e2e/gui/` directory, create a file called `createProject.cy.js` with the following data:

```js
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker/locale/en'

describe("Create Project", () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.login()
  })

  it("successfully", () => {
    const project = {
      name: `project-${faker.datatype.uuid()}`,
      description: faker.random.words(5),
    }

    cy.gui_createProject(project)

    cy.url().should("be.equal", `${Cypress.config("baseUrl")}/${Cypress.env("user_name")}/${project.name}`)
    cy.contains(project.name).should("be.visible")
    cy.contains(project.description).should("be.visible")
  })
})

```

2. Inside the `cypress/support/` directory, update the `gui_commands.js` file with the `gui_createProject` command, as follows:

```js
Cypress.Commands.add('login', () => {
  ...
})

Cypress.Commands.add('logout', () => {
  ...
})

Cypress.Commands.add('gui_createProject', project => {
  cy.visit('/projects/new')

  cy.get('#project_name').type(project.name)
  cy.get('#project_description').type(project.description)
  cy.get('.qa-initialize-with-readme-checkbox').check()
  cy.contains('Create project').click()
})

```

3. Finally, in the command line terminal, at the root of the project, run the command `npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/gui/createProject.cy.js` to run the new test in _headless_ mode.

At the end of the run, you should have a result like the following:

```sh
(Run Finished)


       Spec                                              Tests  Passing  Failing  Pending  Skipped
  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ ✔  createProject.cy.js                      00:06        1        1        -        -        - │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ✔  All specs passed!                        00:06        1        1        -        -        -

```

> Yay! Project creation is also covered by testing!

## Exercise 2 - Interactive mode

Run the new test in interactive mode and try to find out if any part of it could be optimized.

<details><summary>If in doubt, open to see the step-by-step</summary>
</br>

1. In the command line terminal, at the root of the project, run the command `npx cypress open` to open the Cypress App
2. Select the _E2E Testing_ option and launch the Electron browser
3. Click on the `createProject.cy.js` file and watch it run in interactive mode.

> 👨‍🏫 Note that in addition to project creation, _login_ also occurs via _GUI_.
>
> This is a waste, as we already have a test for the _login_ functionality.
>
> The same goes for the _logout_ test, where the user being authenticated is just a precondition.

</details>

## Exercise 3 - Saving the User Session

Make use of the functionality [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) to save the user's session in the browser, and thus optimize the tests, doing _login_ via _GUI_ only for the test that makes sense.

<details><summary>If in doubt, open to see the step-by-step</summary>
</br>

1. In the `cypress/support/gui_commands.js` file, change the custom command from _login_ to the following:

```js
Cypress.Commands.add('login', (
  user = Cypress.env('user_name'),
  password = Cypress.env('user_password'),
  { cacheSession = true } = {},
) => {
  const login = () => {
    cy.visit('/users/sign_in')

    cy.get("[data-qa-selector='login_field']").type(user)
    cy.get("[data-qa-selector='password_field']").type(password, { log: false })
    cy.get("[data-qa-selector='sign_in_button']").click()

    cy.get(".qa-user-avatar").should("be.visible")
  }

  const options = {
    cacheAcrossSpecs: true,
  }

  if (cacheSession) {
    cy.session(user, login, options)
  } else {
    login()
  }
})

Cypress.Commands.add('logout', () => {
  ...
})

Cypress.Commands.add('gui_createProject', () => {
  ...
})

```

> 👨‍🏫 Cypress is now configured to create (and restore) the user's session, saving time for tests where this is just a precondition, as well as continuing to allow _login_ via _GUI_, when this is still the focus, as in the _login_ test itself.
>
> In addition, the new version of the _login_ command is prepared to share the session between _specs_ (test files).

2. In the `cypress/e2e/gui/login.cy.js` file, change its contents to the following:

```js
describe("Login", () => {
  it("successfully", () => {
    const user = Cypress.env("user_name")
    const password = Cypress.env("user_password")
    const options = { cacheSession: false }

    cy.login(user, password, options)
  })
})

```

3. Finally, **close the Cypress App**, open it again (`npx cypress open`) and run the following tests, in this exact order: `createProject.cy.js`, `createProject.cy.js ` (that's right, 2x) and `logout.cy.js`.

> 👨‍🏫 Notice that in the second execution of the project creation test and in the _logout_ test, the user was already authenticated and the tests focused only on what interested them, only on what their "target" was. 🎯

</details>

## Exercise 4 - Validating the session

If you run the `createProject.cy.js` test again after you've implemented the use of the `cy.session()` functionality, you'll notice that if the _logout_ test is run first, the session will be lost and you'll get an error.

This is because the _logout_ test invalidates the session.

Your exercise is to update the custom login command so that, in case the session is invalidated, the _login_ must occur again via the _GUI_ to create a new session.

<details><summary>If in doubt, open to see the step-by-step</summary>
</br>

1. Still via the Cypress App, run the `createProject.cy.js` file again

> 💥 Huh? Cypress tried to restore the session but failed.
>
> 👨‍🏫 This is because the _logout_ test is destroying the session, as this is the essential purpose of the feature.
>
> However, we can check if the session is still valid, and if not, create it again (even if we have to go through the _GUI_). The important thing is that a test cannot fail because of something another test did.
>
> 📣 **"Automated tests must be independent of each other."**

2. In the `cypress/support/gui_commands.js` file, change the custom command from _login_ to the following:

```js
Cypress.Commands.add('login', (
  user = Cypress.env('user_name'),
  password = Cypress.env('user_password'),
  { cacheSession = true } = {},
) => {
  const login = () => {
    cy.visit('/users/sign_in')

    cy.get("[data-qa-selector='login_field']").type(user)
    cy.get("[data-qa-selector='password_field']").type(password, { log: false })
    cy.get("[data-qa-selector='sign_in_button']").click()

    cy.get(".qa-user-avatar").should("be.visible")
  }

  const validate = () => {
    cy.visit('/')
    cy.location('pathname', { timeout: 1000 })
      .should('not.eq', '/users/sign_in')
  }

  const options = {
    cacheAcrossSpecs: true,
    validate,
  }

  if (cacheSession) {
    cy.session(user, login, options)
  } else {
    login()
  }
})


Cypress.Commands.add('logout', () => {
  ...
})

Cypress.Commands.add('gui_createProject', project => {
  ...
})

```

> 👨‍🏫 Now, in addition to the possibility of sharing the session between _specs_, we are also enabling the possibility of validating whether it is still valid, and if not, the _setup_ function (`login`) will be executed by the `cy.session` command.

3. **Close the Cypress App**; open it again with the command `npx cypress open`; choose the _E2E Testing_ option; and launch the Electron browser

4. Finally, via the Cypress App, run all the tests again, as many times as you want, and in any order you want. All of them must pass all runs, independent on the order. Also, one can benefit from the session created by the previous test.

Perfect!

Now that the project creation functionality is covered by tests and the authentication process is streamlined, move on to [lesson 5](./5.md) to test the _issue_ creation functionality.
