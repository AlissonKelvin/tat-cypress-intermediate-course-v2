# _Setup_ of test project with Cypress

In this lesson, we will clone the project, in addition to installing and configuring [Cypress](https://cypress.io).

## Cloning the project

1. Access the URL https://github.com/wlsf82/tat-cypress-intermediate-course-v2
2. Click the _Clone_ button
3. Choose one of the options (_Clone with SSH_ or _Clone with HTTPS_), and then, click on the _Copy URL_ button next to the field of the chosen option

> 👨‍🏫 I prefer the clone via SSH, as I consider it more practical.
>
> For details on creating and configuring an SSH key on GitHub, read the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh).

4. In the command line terminal, in the directory where you store your software projects, type `git clone [URL copied in previous step]` and press ENTER
5. Finally, access the newly cloned project directory (`cd tat-cypress-intermediate-course-v2/`).

## Installing Cypress and other _libs_

In the command line terminal, at the root of the project, run the command `npm i @faker-js/faker@7.6.0 cypress@12.7.0 cypress-plugin-api@2.10.3 -D` (this command will install Cypress and other _libs_ as development dependencies, in addition to creating the `package-lock.json` file and the `node_modules/` directory, where all dependencies are downloaded).

> The _lib_ [`faker`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker) will be used to create random data for the tests
>
> And the _lib_[`cypress-plugin-api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-plugin-api) will be used to provide visual feedback during API tests.

## Initializing Cypress

In the command line terminal, at the root of the project, run the command `npx cypress open` (this command will open the Cypress App, which will guide you in creating the _end-to-end_ (_E2E_) test project.

1. Click on the button to create an _end-to-end_ test project (_E2E Testing_)
2. Accept the configuration files by clicking on the _Continue_ button
3. Select the Electron (or Chrome) browser and click the _Start E2E Testing in **[selected-browser]**_ button
4. Create a first test file by clicking on the _Create new emtpy spec_ option
5. Name the file `login.cy.js`; click the _Create spec_ button; and then, confirm by clicking on the button _Ok, run the spec_
6. After executing the newly created file, close the Electron browser.

### Setting up the automated tests project

1. Close the Cypress App
2. Open the `cypress.config.js` file created in the root of the project and change its contents to the following:

```js
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress")

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: "http://localhost",
  },
  fixturesFolder: false,
  video: false,
})

```

> 🧑‍🏫 Here we are configuring the base URL of the AUT, in addition to not using _fixtures_, and not generating videos after running the tests in _headless_ mode.

3. Still in the root of the project, create a file called `cypress.env.json` with the following data:

```json
{
  "user_name": "root",
  "user_password": "previously-defined-root-user-password",
  "gitlab_access_token": "previously-created-access-token"
}

```

> 🧑‍🏫 This is where we store sensitive data, not versioned by git. See [.gitignore](../.gitignore).

4. Inside the `cypress/` folder, create a subfolder called `downloads/`.

> Your final structure should be `cypress/downloads/`.
>
> This folder will be used later for project clone testing.

5. Finally, delete the `cypress/fixtures/` folder. It won't be used during the course, so better to delete it to avoid distractions.

## Official Cypress Documentation

If you have doubts about any Cypress command during the course, I recommend the [official documentation](https://docs.cypress.io) as your first source of reference.

> We already have everything needed to start testing GitLab (the test application).

Go to [lesson 2](./2.md) to create a test for the _login_ functionality.
