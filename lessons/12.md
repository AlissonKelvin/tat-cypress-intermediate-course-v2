# Running the tests in interactive mode

In this lesson, we are going to run the tests in interactive mode, also with the help of an npm script.

## Exercise 1 - Creating a script to open the Cypress App

Also in the [`package.json`](../package.json) file, create a script that opens the Cypress App to run the tests in interactive mode

<details><summary>If in doubt, open to see the step-by-step</summary>
</br>

1. Open the `package.json` file located at the root of the project
2. In the `scripts` section, add a new script called `cy:open` with the value `cypress open`.

The `scripts` section of the `package.json` file should look like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "cy:open": "cypress open",
  "test": "cypress run"
},

```

3. In the command line terminal, at the root of the project, run the command `npm run cy:open` (this command will open the Cypress App)
4. Choose the _E2E Testing_ option
5. Choose the Electron browser and click the button to launch the tests in the selected browser
6. Click on the test you want to run and watch it run in the browser.

> üë®‚Äçüè´ Take the opportunity to explore the application with the features of _time-traveling_ and _before and after_, visual feedback of API calls due to the use of the `cypress-plugin-api` lib, in addition to the information available in the development tools (_dev tools_).

## Exercise 2 - Configuring Cypress to run all tests in interactive mode

In [version 11.2.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#11-2-0), Cypress re-released (as an experimental feature) the possibility to run all tests in interactive mode.

Your exercise is to enable this experimental functionality and run all tests via the Cypress App.

</br>

1. In the `cypress.config.js` file, enable the experimental functionality [`experimentalRunAllSpecs`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing) as shown below :

```js
const { defineConfig } = require("cypress")

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: "http://localhost",
    env: {
      hideCredentials: true,
      requestMode: true,
    },
    experimentalRunAllSpecs: true,
  },
  fixturesFolder: false,
  video: false,
})

```

2. With the Cypress App open, run (at once) all tests in interactive mode.
