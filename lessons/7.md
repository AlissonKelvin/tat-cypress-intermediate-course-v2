# Testing _issue_ creation via API

In this lesson, your challenge is to successfully test the _issue_ creation scenario (via API).

## Exercise

Create an automated test that exercises the _issue_ creation functionality via the API.

### Useful information about the API

- The relative _endpoint_ for creating _issues_ is `/api/v4/projects/:projectId/issues`
- The verb for creating _issues_ is `POST`
- The attributes that must be passed in the `body` of the request are: `title` (String) and `description` (String)
- An authorization token (`Authorization`) must be passed in the `headers`, prefixed by `Bearer `
- After successfully creating the _issue_, the request response status should be `201`.

</br>

1. Inside the `cypress/e2e/api/` directory, create a file called `createIssue.cy.js` with the following data:

```js
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker/locale/en'

describe("Create issue", () => {
  beforeEach(() => cy.api_deleteProjects())

  it("successfully", () => {
    const issue = {
      title: `issue-${faker.datatype.uuid()}`,
      description: faker.random.words(3),
      project: {
        name: `project-${faker.datatype.uuid()}`,
        description: faker.random.words(5),
      },
    }

    cy.api_createIssue(issue).then((response) => {
      expect(response.status).to.equal(201)
      expect(response.body.title).to.equal(issue.title)
      expect(response.body.description).to.equal(issue.description)
    })
  })
})

```

2. Inside the `cypress/support/` directory, update the `api_commands.js` file with the `api_createIssue` command, as follows:

```js
const accessToken = `Bearer ${Cypress.env('gitlab_access_token')}`

Cypress.Commands.add('api_createProject', project => {
  ...
})

Cypress.Commands.add('api_getAllProjects', () => {
  ...
})

Cypress.Commands.add('api_deleteProjects', () => {
  ...
})

Cypress.Commands.add('api_createIssue', issue => {
  cy.api_createProject(issue.project)
    .then(response => {
      cy.request({
        method: 'POST',
        url: `/api/v4/projects/${response.body.id}/issues`,
        body: {
          title: issue.title,
          description: issue.description
        },
        headers: { Authorization: accessToken },
      })
  })
})

```

3. Via the Cypress App, run the `cypress/e2e/api/createIssue.cy.js` file.

> üë®‚Äçüè´ Notice how creating _issue_ via API is also much faster.

Go to [lesson 8](./8.md) to test (optimally) adding a _label_ to an _issue_.
