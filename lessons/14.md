# Talking About Testing's Cypress Content

> Since I'm Brazilian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, most of my content is in Portuguese, but I have a few in English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ too.

To help you in your adventures with Cypress, I've been creating all sorts of content, from _blog posts_ in tutorial format, _lives_ on YouTube, hands-on videos and interviews with professionals about using the tool.

You can have them as learning resources for the course.

## Pinches of Cypress

In the [Pinches of Cypress series](https://dev.to/walmyrlimaesilv/series/11377), you will find content in the form of tutorials on how to solve diverse problems using Cypress (content in English).

## `cy.handsOn()`

The _playlist_ [`cy.handsOn()`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-eblSNRj0QHIRCg9hYUYzSY87EyWo4k_) is similar to "Pinches of Cypress", however, instead of text, they are video tutorials (content in PT-BR).

## `cy.chat()`

In the _playlist_ [`cy.chat()`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-eblSNRj0QH95Kx6iMR_Fwk5WsCM89Ha), I interview professionals who use Cypress, where they share their industry experiences.

In this _playlist_, you will find content in Portuguese and English, including interviews with other [Cypress.io ambassadors](https://www.cypress.io/ambassadors/).

## Exploring the Cypress Real-World App (RWA)

When I started doing _lives_ on YouTube, [four of them](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-eblSNRj0QGU6gO4Yhb27ZwaCASG-lQl) were: exploring _end-to-end_ tests; API tests; unit tests; and the Continuous Integration of the [Cypress RWA](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app) (content in PT-BR).

## Exploring the Cypress Examples

Also, I made a _playlist_ of [six episodes](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-eblSNRj0QFFRzKi2GP0U-I5xFlUHW5E), exploring several examples created by the Cypress team (content in PT-BR).

## _API Testing_

[In this _playlist_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-eblSNRj0QGkMqsqxUvy7VI4VfXEUp-G), you will find very diverse "hands-on" videos regarding API testing with Cypress (content in PT-BR and EN).

## `cy.session`

[In this _playlist_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-eblSNRj0QF1RA4fd9FrDVov_uyYfCAL), you will find hands-on content about using Cypress's `cy.session()` functionality (content in PT-BR).
