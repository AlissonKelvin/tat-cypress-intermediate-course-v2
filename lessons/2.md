# Testing the _login_ functionality

In this lesson, your challenge is to successfully test the _login_ scenario.

## Exercise

Create an automated test that exercises the _login_ functionality via the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

<details><summary>If in doubt, open to see the step-by-step</summary>
</br>

1. Inside the `cypress/e2e/` directory, create a new directory called `gui/`
2. Then, move the `login.cy.js` file to the newly created directory and modify its data to the following:

```js
describe("Login", () => {
  it("successfully", () => {
    cy.login()

    cy.get(".qa-user-avatar").should("be.visible")
  })
})

```

3. Inside the `cypress/support/` directory, rename the `commands.js` file to `gui_commands.js` and change its contents to the following:

```js
Cypress.Commands.add("login", (user = Cypress.env("user_name"), password = Cypress.env("user_password")) => {
  const login = () => {
    cy.visit("/users/sign_in")

    cy.get("[data-qa-selector='login_field']").type(user)
    cy.get("[data-qa-selector='password_field']").type(password, { log: false })
    cy.get("[data-qa-selector='sign_in_button']").click()
  }

  login()
})

```

4. Inside the `cypress/support/` directory, change the `e2e.js` file data to the following:

```js
import "./gui_commands"

```

5. Finally, in the command line terminal, at the root of the project, run the command `npx cypress run --spec cypress/e2e/gui/login.cy.js` to run the new test in _headless_ mode.

At the end of the run, you should have a result like the following:

```sh
(Run Finished)


       Spec                                              Tests  Passing  Failing  Pending  Skipped

  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Alright, _login_ is covered by tests. Did you notice you've just created your first passing test?

Feel free to test how it would behave if you'd break it.

<details><summary>For example... (Click here to see!)</summary>
</br>

```js
describe("Login", () => {
  it("successfully", () => {
    cy.login()

    // Notice the invalid class.
    cy.get(".ua-user-uvutur").should("be.visible")
  })
})

```

> Remember to change it back to the working version!
