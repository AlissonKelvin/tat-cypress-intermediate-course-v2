# Overview of the course

Discover what's in the Cypress Intermediate course from the [TAT School](https://udemy.com/user/walmyr).

## Prerequisites

In the [prerequisites](./_pre-requirements_.md) section, you will find all the necessary things you need to get started.

> ⚠️ It is extremely important that **all** requirements are met!

## Learning about the application under test (AUT)

In the [Getting to know the AUT](./_the-app_.md) section, you will be presented with a complex and complete application that you can run locally.

In TAT School courses, you learn hands-on how to create automated tests for real web applications, and you will also learn in depth how the web application works.

## _Setup_ of local environment with Docker

In the [Setup of the local environment](./0.md) lesson, you will start "getting your hands dirty".

The application under test is available through a Docker image at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

> ⚠️ It is expected that you have introductory Docker skills to deal with problems that may occur. Such topics as blocks for using corporate computers, ports already allocated, etc. are beyond the scope of this course.

## _Setup_ of test project with Cypress

In the [Setup of the test project](./1.md) lesson, you'll learn how to install and configure an automated test project with Cypress.

## Lessons

With the application and test project configured, there will be specific lessons for creating automated test scripts.

### Exercises

In my opinion, practicing is the best way to make your new skills stick.

Therefore, each lesson will have one or more exercises.

For each exercise, there are code snippets with a possible solution.

## Talking About Testing Cypress Contents

At the end of the course, I leave [references to Cypress contents](./14.md) created on the TAT channels (Blog and YouTube), as auxiliary study sources (**some of the content is in Portuguese**.)

Now that you know the structure of the course, see you in the [pre-requisites](./_pre-requirements_.md) section.
